# Simple e-commerce

  This project is an exercise at the same time to fill my portfolio. As the name of the repository suggests, this project is an e-commerce. This project is still not perfect and maybe far from perfect, but I hope that as I increase my knowledge in website development I want to continue to develop this application as my portfolio. And if anyone is interested in having a look or making this project a reference, please use it. If anyone wants to clone this project, please checkout the master branch. I save the project in that branch.

Thank you if anyone makes my project as a reference.
